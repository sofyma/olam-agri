# Game 3 - Debugging Changes

## Problem
The first checkpoint is still showing question order 6 instead of 1, even after implementing order-based logic.

## Debugging Changes Made

### **1. Added Console Logging to Game3Service**

**Added to `loadQuestions` function:**
```typescript
console.log('Raw Sanity questions:', sanityQuestions);
console.log('Processed questions:', this.questions);
```

### **2. Added Fallback Logic for Missing Order Field**

**Updated question processing:**
```typescript
// Use the order field if available, otherwise fall back to index + 1
const orderValue = q.order || (index + 1);

return {
  id: orderValue, // Use the order field as the ID
  // ... other fields
};
```

### **3. Added Sorting by Order Value**

**Added after filtering:**
```typescript
.sort((a: Question, b: Question) => a.id - b.id); // Sort by order value
```

### **4. Added Console Logging to Game3Store**

**Added to checkpoint collision logic:**
```typescript
console.log('Setting starting question order:', startingQuestionOrder);
console.log('Available questions:', state.questions.map(q => ({ id: q.id, question: q.question })));
```

**Added to answerQuestion function:**
```typescript
console.log('Looking for question with order:', state.currentQuestionOrder);
console.log('Available questions:', state.questions.map(q => ({ id: q.id, question: q.question })));
```

## What to Check

### **1. Browser Console Output**
When you reach the first checkpoint, check the browser console for:
- **Raw Sanity questions**: Shows the raw data from Sanity
- **Processed questions**: Shows the processed questions with their order values
- **Setting starting question order**: Shows what order value is being set
- **Available questions**: Shows all available questions and their order values
- **Looking for question with order**: Shows what order value is being searched for

### **2. Expected Output**
If everything is working correctly, you should see:
- **Raw Sanity questions**: Array of questions with `order` field values
- **Processed questions**: Array sorted by order value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- **Setting starting question order**: Should show `1` for first checkpoint
- **Available questions**: Should show questions with IDs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- **Looking for question with order**: Should show `1` and find the question

### **3. Potential Issues to Look For**

#### **Issue 1: Missing Order Field**
If you see `order: undefined` in the raw Sanity questions, the order field isn't set in Sanity.

#### **Issue 2: Wrong Order Values**
If the order values are not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, the questions aren't set up correctly in Sanity.

#### **Issue 3: Questions Not Found**
If "Looking for question with order: 1" shows but no question is found, there's a mismatch between expected and actual order values.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the application** and reach the first checkpoint
2. **Check browser console** for the debug output
3. **Share the console output** so we can identify the exact issue
4. **Fix the root cause** based on what the debugging reveals

The debugging will help us understand exactly what's happening and why the first question is showing order 6 instead of 1.
